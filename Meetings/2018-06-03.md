# Meeting Notes:
- Problems:
  - Bad data
    - We tested visual cortex data on OpenBCI console but not on our own collection methodologies
    - OpenBCI console got better real-time results
  - Need to ensure better real-time performance

- Plan:
  - focus on getting SOFTWARE to work; worry about hardware later
  - separate GUI from back end
  - make back-end architecture reusable with minimal steps

- Timeline:
  1) Get desktop version of tagger working
    - focus on SPEED (as close to real-time as possible)
    - focus on REUSABILITY
  2) Get desktop version of MindType working
  3) Public 'neurostack' aka reusable back-end architecture

- Tagger:
  - make a tagging console that shows live data



- Tasks:
  - Karl, Musa: benchmark OpenBCINode vs NTUofT's OpenBCIPython
  - what GUI framework should we use? Can we find something better than Electron that still supports web app deployment to desktop, etc
  - fast message queueing system for Python?
  - what to use for back end? Flask? Sanic? Pure Python? etc
  - How to simplify / encapsulate current architecture for reuse?
